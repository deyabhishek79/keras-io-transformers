    "Question answering is a common NLP task with several variants. In some variants, the task is multiple-choice: \n",
    "A list of possible answers are supplied with each question, and the model simply needs to return a probability distribution over the options. A more challenging variant of question answering, which is more applicable to real-life tasks, is when the options are not provided. Instead, the model is given an input document and a question about the document, and it must extract the span of text in the document that contains the answer. In this case, the model is not computing a probability distribution over answers, but two probability distributions over the tokens in the document text, representing the start and end of the span containing the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question answering of this kind is a very challenging NLP task, and the dataset size required to train such a model from scratch when the questions and answers are natural language is prohibitively huge. As a result, question answering (like almost all NLP tasks) benefits enormously from starting from a strong pre-trained foundation model - starting from a strong pre-trained language model can reduce the dataset size required to reach a given accuracy by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling you to reach very strong performance with surprisingly reasonable datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with a pre-trained model adds difficulties, though - where do you get the model from? How do you ensure that your input data is preprocessed and tokenized the same way as the original model? How do you modify the model to add an output head that matches your task of interest?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll show you how to load a model from the Hugging Face [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library to tackle this challenge. We'll also load a benchmark question answering dataset from the [🤗 Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library - this is another open-source repository containing a wide range of datasets across many modalities, from NLP to vision and beyond. Note, though, that there is no requirement that these libraries must be used with each other. If you want to train a model from [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) on your own data, or you want to load data from [🤗 Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and train your own entirely unrelated models with it, that is of course possible (and highly encouraged!)"

The list of models to choose from can be bewildering, but in general there is a simple tradeoff: Larger models are slower and consume more memory, but usually yield slightly better final accuracies after fine-tuning. For this example, we have chosen the (relatively) lightweight `distilbert`, a smaller, distilled version of the famous BERT language model. If you absolutely must have the highest possible accuracy for an important task, though, and you have the GPU memory (and free time) to handle it, you may prefer to use a larger model, such as `roberta-large`. Newer and even larger models than `roberta` exist in [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), but we leave the task of finding and training them as an exercise to readers who are either particularly masochistic or have 40GB of VRAM to throw around.

To deal with this, we will allow one (long) example in our dataset to give several input features, each of length shorter than the maximum length of the model (or the one we set as a hyper-parameter). Also, just in case the answer lies at the point we split a long context, we allow some overlap between the features we generate controlled by the hyper-parameter `doc_stride`. \n",

To get the list of features capped by the maximum length, we need to set \"return_overflowing_tokens\" to True and pass the doc_stride to stride. To see which feature of the original context contain the answer, we can return \"offset_mapping\"."
